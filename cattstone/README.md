**Overview**

This Hack Reactor front-end project is a single-page shopping website simulation of e-commerce websites. Users will be able to interact with the UI and view products or services for sale. Feature highlights include adding user questions, reviews, and uploading photos using a restful API.

Given a wireframe design, our group of three software engineering students had to develop a front-end project reflecting the design and following a list of features requirements.

**Description**

Our application allows the user to click through products and styles to add to their shopping carts. In addition, users can see the current questions asked for the selected product as well as add their own questions & answers. At the very bottom, users can view reviews written by other customers. There is a star rating for each product. The user can add their own rating and review to the products. Overall, there is a click tracker that logs the usersâ€™ click interactions into an API.
